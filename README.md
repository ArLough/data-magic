# Data Magic (OpenAI Utility API)

This project provides an API for generating content using OpenAI's completion models. It includes a `ContentGenerator` class, utility functions, and a simple Flask app to generate content based on prompts, templates, and other configurations.

## Current Goals

### 1. API Development

- Expand the API to handle HTTP requests, allowing users to interact with the content generation features using tools like Postman, Thunder Client, etc.
- Implement various API endpoints for different content generation operations, such as creating, updating, and deleting content.

### 2. CLI Commands

- Develop CLI commands to create content locally while the Flask app is running, providing a more convenient way to interact with the content generation features.

### 3. Error Handling

- Implement robust error handling throughout the application to provide helpful feedback to users and ensure the stability of the system.

### 4. Advanced File Editing

- Add advanced file editing capabilities, such as inserting, replacing, and removing content from existing files and directories.

### 5. Improved Prompts

- Design better prompts for content generation to enhance the quality and relevance of the generated content.

### 6. Enhanced Templates

- Create more sophisticated templates for various content types and use cases, providing users with greater flexibility in customizing their generated content.

### 7. Unsplash Integration

- Integrate Unsplash functionality into the templates, allowing users to include relevant images in their generated content.

## Future Plans

### 1. Integration of Additional OpenAI Services

- Integrate more of OpenAI's services into the tool, such as DALL-E, Whisper, Fine-Tuning, etc., to create even more advanced tooling and markdown content.

### 2. RSS Bridge for Climate Data Fine-Tuning

- Develop a unique RSS bridge to collect and process climate data, which will be used for fine-tuning the AI model and enhancing the quality and relevance of the generated content.

### 3. Climate Tech Chatbot

- Use the resource database and RSS bridge, along with fine-tuning, to create the "Climate Tech Chatbot," a tool designed to provide users with valuable insights and information on climate technologies and trends.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it.
3. Install the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Setting and Using the OpenAI API Key

To use the generator, you will need an OpenAI API key. Follow these steps to set and use the `OPENAI_SECRET_KEY`:

1. Obtain your OpenAI API key from this [OpenAI page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys), you may have to create an account if you have not yet.
2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project (if it doesn't already exist).
3. Add your OpenAI API key to the `.env` file in the following format:

`OPENAI_SECRET_KEY=your_api_key_here`

Replace `your_api_key_here` with the actual key you obtained from OpenAI.

Add this to your .env as well:

`UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY=your_api_key_here`


4. In your Python code, you can use the `dotenv` library to load the API key from the `.env` file:

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

load_dotenv()
api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_SECRET_KEY")
```

### Running the Flask App

1. Run the Flask app by executing `flask run` or try `python app.py` if struggling, but you should make sure flask is installed.
2. The app will create a file for a specific topic using the prompts, templates, and configurations provided in the `data` folder.
   - At this moment in the app it's being forced with a `@before_request` decorator, this will be improved upon in the future.
3. The generated file will be saved in the `output_test` folder.

### Using the ContentGenerator Class

1. Import the `ContentGenerator` class from the `models.content_generator` module.
2. Create an instance of the `ContentGenerator` class with the necessary parameters, such as `api_key`, `yml_files`, `csv_files`, and `template_mds`.
3. Use the `create_completion()` method to generate content based on a specific prompt.
4. Use the `create_output()` method to generate content for a specific topic using the prompts, templates, and configurations provided.
5. Use the `write_output()` method to save the generated content to a file.

## Example

```python
from models.content_generator import ContentGenerator

yml_files = ["data/prompts/prompts.yml"]
csv_files = ["data/csv/file_info.csv"]
template_mds = ["data/templates/template.md"]
output_dir = "output_test"

generator = ContentGenerator(api_key="your_api_key", yml_files=yml_files, csv_files=csv_files, template_mds=template_mds, output_dir=output_dir)

page = generator.file_info[1]
output = generator.create_output(page)
generator.write_output(page, output)
```
