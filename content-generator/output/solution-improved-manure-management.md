## Progress Made

In the past decade, there have been great strides made in developing improved manure management practices to help reverse climate change. One of the most significant breakthrough technologies in this area is the development of anaerobic digesters. Anaerobic digesters are able to capture methane gas emissions from manure and convert them into renewable energy. This technology has been shown to be very effective in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from livestock operations. Other breakthrough technologies that have been developed include manure separators and solid-liquid separation systems. These technologies help to reduce the amount of manure that is produced, which can also help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

## Lessons Learned

Some of the key lessons that have been learned in the development and implementation of Improved Manure Management to mitigate the effects of climate change include:

1. The need for a comprehensive and coordinated approach: Improved Manure Management must be part of a comprehensive and coordinated approach to climate change mitigation. It is not a silver bullet and must be implemented alongside other measures such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural production.

2. The importance of involving all stakeholders: The development and implementation of Improved Manure Management requires the involvement of all stakeholders, including farmers, extension agents, policy-makers, and the private sector.

3. The need for technical and financial support: Technical and financial support is essential for the successful development and implementation of Improved Manure Management.

4. The importance of monitoring and evaluation: Monitoring and evaluation are essential to ensure the effectiveness of Improved Manure Management and to make necessary adjustments.

## Challenges Ahead

The major challenge that remains in the development and implementation of Improved Manure Management to reverse climate change is the lack of awareness and understanding of the importance of this technology. There is a need to educate farmers, policy makers and the general public about the potential of this technology to help mitigate climate change. Additionally, there is a need to overcome the financial and technical barriers to widespread adoption of this technology.

## Best Path Forward

There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the best path forward for the continued development and implementation of Improved Manure Management (IMM) to effectively mitigate the effects of climate change will vary depending on the specific context and needs of each region. However, some general steps that need to be taken to ensure that IMM is adopted on a large scale and is effective include:

1. Increasing awareness of the benefits of IMM among farmers and other stakeholders.

2. Providing financial incentives for farmers to adopt IMM practices.

3. Supporting research and development of new and improved IMM technologies.

4. Ensuring that government policies and regulations are supportive of IMM adoption and implementation.

5. Monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of IMM practices on a regular basis.
