# Distributed Energy Storage

## Progress Made



In the area of renewable energy, great strides have been made in the development of solar, wind, and hydro power. Numerous companies and organizations have been instrumental in advancing these technologies, and as a result, greenhouse gas emissions have been reduced significantly.

In the area of transportation, electric vehicles have become increasingly popular and efficient, and as a result, emissions from this sector have begun to decline.

In the area of buildings, energy-efficiency standards have been enacted in many jurisdictions, resulting in the construction of more energy-efficient buildings that use less energy and generate fewer emissions.

These are just a few examples of the progress that has been made in the fight against climate change. As more and more companies and organizations invest in clean technologies, we can expect further reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in the years to come.

## Best Path Forward



The continued development and implementation of this technology will require a concerted effort from the public and private sectors. The private sector will need to invest in the research and development of this technology and the public sector will need to provide the necessary incentives to encourage adoption.

In order to ensure that this technology is adopted on a large scale, it is important to educate the public on the benefits of this technology and the potential it has to mitigate the effects of climate change. It is also important to create awareness about the need for this technology and the urgency of the situation. The government can play a role in this by providing funding for research and development and by creating incentives for the private sector to invest in this technology.
