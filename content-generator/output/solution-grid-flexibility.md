# Grid Flexibility

## Progress Made



The progress that has been made with the solution {Topic} is the development of breakthrough technologies that have impacted the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Some examples of these technologies are:

1. Carbon capture and storage: This technology captures carbon dioxide from power plants and other industrial facilities, and then stores it deep underground, preventing it from entering the atmosphere.

2. Renewable energy: This includes technologies such as solar, wind, and hydro power, which generate electricity without emitting greenhouse gases.

3. Electric vehicles: Electric vehicles are powered by electricity instead of gasoline or diesel, and produce zero emissions.

4. Fuel cells: Fuel cells generate electricity through a chemical reaction, and can be powered by renewable fuels such as hydrogen.

5. Energy efficiency: This includes a variety of technologies and practices that reduce the amount of energy needed to power homes and businesses, resulting in less greenhouse gas emissions.
