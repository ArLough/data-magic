# Landfill Methane Capture

## Progress Made



In the past decade, there have been many breakthrough technologies related to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. One example is carbon capture and storage (CCS), which is a process of capturing carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and industrial facilities and storing it in underground reservoirs. CCS has been developed by many companies and organizations, including the Global CCS Institute, Carbon Clean Solutions, and Carbon Engineering. CCS has had a significant impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and is expected to continue to do so in the future.
