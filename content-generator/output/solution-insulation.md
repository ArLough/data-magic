## Progress Made

In the United States, progress has been made in developing landfill methane capture to reverse climate change. Breakthrough technologies that have been developed include the use of flares to capture methane gas, and the use of covers to prevent methane gas from escaping into the atmosphere. These technologies have contributed to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by capturing methane gas before it escapes into the atmosphere.

## Lessons Learned

Some of the key lessons that have been learned in the development and implementation of Landfill Methane Capture to mitigate the effects of climate change include the importance of site selection, gas collection system design, and gas utilization options. Additionally, it is important to have a detailed understanding of the landfill gas composition in order to optimize the methane capture process.

One of the main challenges associated with landfill methane capture is that it is a complex technology with many different moving parts. This can make it difficult to design and implement an effective system. Additionally, the technology is often reliant on the cooperation of multiple stakeholders, which can be difficult to coordinate.

Despite these challenges, landfill methane capture has been shown to be an effective way to reduce methane emissions from landfills. Additionally, the technology can provide a valuable source of renewable energy.

## Challenges Ahead

There are several major challenges that remain in the development and implementation of landfill methane capture to reverse climate change. First, the technology is still in its early stages of development and needs to be further tested and refined. Second, the infrastructure required to implement this technology on a large scale is expensive and needs to be developed. Finally, there is a need to raise awareness of this technology and its potential benefits in order to encourage its widespread adoption.

## Best Path Forward

The best path forward for the continued development and implementation of Landfill Methane Capture to effectively mitigate the effects of climate change is to continue to research and develop the technology so that it can be adopted on a large scale. There are a number of steps that need to be taken to ensure that this technology is effective, including:

1. Conducting research to improve the technology and make it more efficient
2. Working with governments and other organizations to promote the adoption of the technology
3. Providing training and support to those who will be using the technology
4. Monitoring and evaluating the performance of the technology to ensure that it is effective
