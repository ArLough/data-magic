## Progress Made



Some companies and organizations that have developed breakthrough technologies related to climate change and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions include:

1. Carbon Engineering: Carbon Engineering is a Canadian company that has developed a technology that captures carbon dioxide directly from the air and converts it into a fuel. The company is currently working on a commercial-scale plant that will capture one million tons of carbon dioxide per year.

2. Climeworks: Climeworks is a Swiss company that has developed a technology that captures carbon dioxide from the air and stores it underground. The company has a commercial plant in operation that captures 900 tons of carbon dioxide per year.

3. Global Thermostat: Global Thermostat is an American company that has developed a technology that captures carbon dioxide from the air and uses it to make products such as concrete and plastics. The company is currently working on a commercial-scale plant that will capture one million tons of carbon dioxide per year.

4. Green Mountain Power: Green Mountain Power is an American utility company that has developed a technology that captures carbon dioxide from the air and uses it to generate electricity. The company has a commercial plant in operation that captures 100,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year.

5. Carbon Recycling International: Carbon Recycling International is an Icelandic company that has developed a technology that captures carbon dioxide from the air and converts it into a fuel. The company has a commercial plant in operation that captures 50,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year.

These companies have all made significant progress in developing technologies that can capture carbon dioxide from the air and convert it into a fuel or other useful product. These technologies have the potential to make a significant impact on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.
