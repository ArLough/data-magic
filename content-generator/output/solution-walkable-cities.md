## Progress Made

Some progress that has been made in developing Walkable Cities to reverse climate change includes the development of more fuel-efficient vehicles, electric vehicles, and public transportation. These breakthrough technologies have contributed to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by providing alternatives to using cars and trucks for transportation.

## Lessons Learned

Some of the key lessons that have been learned in the development and implementation of Walkable Cities to mitigate the effects of climate change include the importance of community engagement, the need for dedicated funding, and the challenges of sustaining momentum.

One of the biggest successes of Walkable Cities has been the engagement of community members in the planning and implementation process. This has been crucial in ensuring that the project meets the needs of the people it is designed to serve and that there is buy-in from those who will be using the infrastructure.

Another success has been the dedicated funding that has been provided for the project. This has allowed for the construction of high-quality infrastructure and the hiring of staff to maintain it.

However, there have also been some failures associated with the technology and its use. One of the biggest challenges has been sustaining momentum after the initial investment has been made. This is often difficult to do without dedicated funding or a clear plan for maintenance and operations. Additionally, the infrastructure that has been built is not always used as intended, which can lead to waste and inefficiency.

## Challenges Ahead

The major challenges that remain in the development and implementation of Walkable Cities to reverse climate change are:

1. The need to create more walkable neighborhoods and streets
2. The need to increase funding for pedestrian infrastructure
3. The need for more political will to support pedestrian-friendly policies
4. The need to educate the public about the benefits of walking

## Best Path Forward

The best path forward for the continued development and implementation of Walkable Cities to effectively mitigate the effects of climate change is to continue to advocate for their adoption on a large scale, and to work with municipalities to ensure that they are effective. Steps that need to be taken to ensure that this technology is adopted on a large scale and is effective include:

1. Increasing awareness of the benefits of Walkable Cities among the general public.

2. Working with municipalities to create incentives for developers to build walkable neighborhoods.

3. Conducting research to develop best practices for designing and constructing walkable neighborhoods.

4. Providing technical assistance to municipalities and developers who are interested in creating walkable neighborhoods.

5. Evaluating the effectiveness of Walkable Cities in mitigating the effects of climate change.
