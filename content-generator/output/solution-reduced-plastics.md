# Reduced Plastics

## Progress Made



Some examples of companies and organizations that have developed breakthrough technologies related to climate change and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions include:

1. Carbon Engineering: Carbon Engineering is a Canadian company that has developed a technology called Direct Air Capture (DAC), which captures carbon dioxide (CO2) directly from the atmosphere. The captured CO2 can then be used to make fuels and other products, or it can be stored underground.

2. Climeworks: Climeworks is a Swiss company that has developed a technology called CO2 Capture, which captures CO2 from the air and then sells it to customers who use it for things like enhanced oil recovery or carbonated beverages.

3. Global Thermostat: Global Thermostat is an American company that has developed a technology called Air to Fuel, which captures CO2 from the atmosphere and converts it into a variety of fuels, including hydrogen.

4. Keeling Curve: Keeling Curve is an American company that has developed a technology called Carbon Sequestration, which captures CO2 from the atmosphere and stores it in the form of limestone.

5. Carbon Clean Solutions: Carbon Clean Solutions is an Indian company that has developed a technology called Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), which captures CO2 from power plants and industrial facilities, and then stores it underground.

These are just a few examples of the many companies and organizations that are working on developing breakthrough technologies to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change.
