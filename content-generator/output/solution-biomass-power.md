## Progress Made



Some examples of companies and organizations that have developed breakthrough technologies related to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions are:

1. Carbon Engineering: Carbon Engineering is a Canadian company that has developed a technology called Direct Air Capture (DAC). DAC involves capturing carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere and then storing it underground. This technology can be used to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere on a large scale, potentially helping to mitigate climate change.

2. Climeworks: Climeworks is a Swiss company that has developed a technology called Direct Air Capture with Carbon Storage (DACCS). DACCS involves capturing carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere and then storing it in underground reservoirs. This technology can be used to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere on a large scale, potentially helping to mitigate climate change.

3. Carbon Clean Solutions: Carbon Clean Solutions is an Indian company that has developed a technology called carbon capture and sequestration (CCS). CCS involves capturing carbon dioxide from industrial emissions and then storing it underground. This technology can be used to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from industries, potentially helping to mitigate climate change.

4. Svante: Svante is a Canadian company that has developed a technology called carbon capture and utilization (CCU). CCU involves capturing carbon dioxide from industrial emissions and then using it to create products such as concrete or plastics. This technology can be used to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from industries, potentially helping to mitigate climate change.

5. Global Thermostat: Global Thermostat is an American company that has developed a technology called air capture. Air capture involves capturing carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere and then storing it underground. This technology can be used to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere on a large scale, potentially helping to mitigate climate change.
