# Net Zero Buildings

## Progress Made



In the past decade, there have been many breakthrough technologies that have been developed in relation to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. One example is the development of electric vehicles. Electric vehicles have been shown to be much more efficient than traditional gasoline-powered vehicles, and they do not produce any emissions. Another example is the development of solar panels. Solar panels have become much more efficient in recent years, and they are now able to generate a significant amount of electricity with very little environmental impact.
