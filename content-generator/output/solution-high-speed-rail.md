## Progress Made



Some examples of companies and organizations that have developed breakthrough technologies related to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions reductions are:

1. Carbon Engineering: Carbon Engineering is a Canadian company that has developed a technology called Direct Air Capture (DAC). This technology sucks in air from the atmosphere and then removes the carbon dioxide (CO2) from it. The CO2 can then be used for things like enhanced oil recovery or to create carbon-neutral fuels.

2. Climeworks: Climeworks is a Swiss company that has developed a similar technology to Carbon Engineering's DAC, but with some important differences. Climeworks' technology can be used not only to remove CO2 from the atmosphere, but also to capture it from power plants and other industrial sources.

3. Global Thermostat: Global Thermostat is a US-based company that has developed a technology called air-to-carbon (A2C). This technology captures CO2 from the atmosphere and then converts it into a variety of useful chemicals and fuels.

4. Blue Planet: Blue Planet is a Canadian company that has developed a technology called the Blue Planet Process (BPP). This technology captures CO2 from the atmosphere and then sequesters it deep underground.

5. CarbonCure: CarbonCure is a Canadian company that has developed a technology that captures CO2 from the atmosphere and then uses it to create stronger and more environmentally friendly concrete.

## Best Path Forward



The first step is to ensure that the technology is developed to a point where it is able to be implemented on a large scale. This will require significant investment in research and development, as well as testing to ensure that the technology is effective. Once the technology is ready for large-scale implementation, there needs to be a concerted effort to promote its use and adoption. This will require working with governments, businesses, and other stakeholders to create incentives for using the technology and to ensure that it is incorporated into planning and decision-making processes.
