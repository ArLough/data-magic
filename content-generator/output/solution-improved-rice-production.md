# Improved Rice Production

## Progress Made



Some examples of organizations that have developed breakthrough technologies related to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions are the Carbon Capture and Storage Association, the International Renewable Energy Agency, and the Climate Group. These organizations have developed technologies that capture carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and industrial facilities, store them underground, and convert them into renewable energy. These technologies have helped to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 90%.
