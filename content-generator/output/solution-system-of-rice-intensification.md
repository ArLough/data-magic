## Progress Made

System of Rice Intensification (SRI) is a set of agronomic principles and practices that have been shown to significantly increase the productivity of irrigated rice. SRI involves the use of young seedlings, spaced widely apart, and grown in aerobic conditions with minimal water and fertilizer. These practices result in higher yields and lower greenhouse gas emissions per unit of rice produced.

Some of the key breakthrough technologies that have contributed to the success of SRI include the use of plastic mulch to reduce evaporation and the use of precision irrigation to apply water only when and where it is needed. These technologies have helped to reduce water use and greenhouse gas emissions in rice production.

## Lessons Learned

Some of the key lessons that have been learned in the development and implementation of System of Rice Intensification to mitigate the effects of climate change include the importance of proper land preparation, the use of appropriate seed varieties, and the need for effective pest and disease management. Additionally, it has been found that successful adoption of SRI requires close collaboration between farmers, extension workers, and other stakeholders.

However, there have also been some failures associated with SRI, particularly in terms of its adoption and scaling up. One of the biggest challenges has been getting farmers to change their traditional practices, which can be deeply ingrained. Additionally, SRI requires a higher level of management and investment than traditional rice production, which can be a barrier for many small-scale farmers.

## Challenges Ahead

The major challenges that remain in the development and implementation of System of Rice Intensification to reverse climate change are:

1) Ensuring that farmers have access to the necessary inputs (e.g. quality seeds, fertilizer, water)

2) Educating and training farmers on how to properly implement SRI techniques

3) Conducting further research to improve and optimize SRI methods

4) Addressing the challenges posed by pests and diseases

5) Scaling up and widely adopting SRI methods to ensure that they are effective in mitigating climate change.

## Best Path Forward

The best path forward for the continued development and implementation of the System of Rice Intensification (SRI) to effectively mitigate the effects of climate change is to continue to promote and support the adoption of SRI on a large scale. To ensure that SRI is effective, it is important to continue to research and develop new methods and technologies to improve the efficiency of SRI. Additionally, it is important to provide training and extension services to farmers to ensure that they are able to properly implement SRI.
