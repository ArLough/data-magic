# Concentrated Solar Power

## Progress Made



Some examples of companies and organizations that have developed breakthrough technologies related to reducing greenhouse gas emissions are:

1. Carbon Engineering: Carbon Engineering is a Canadian company that has developed a technology called Direct Air Capture (DAC), which captures carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere. DAC has the potential to remove large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, helping to mitigate climate change.

2. Climeworks: Climeworks is a Swiss company that has developed a technology called Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). CCS captures carbon dioxide from power plants and other industrial facilities, and stores it underground. This helps to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and mitigate climate change.

3. Carbon Clean Solutions: Carbon Clean Solutions is an Indian company that has developed a technology called Carbon Dioxide Utilization (CDU). CDU captures carbon dioxide from power plants and other industrial facilities, and uses it to make products such as concrete and chemicals. This helps to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and mitigate climate change.
