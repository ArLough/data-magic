# Waste to Energy

## Progress Made



In the past decade, there have been significant advances in the development of low-carbon technologies, including renewables, nuclear, and carbon capture and storage. These technologies have been adopted by a number of companies and organizations around the world and have had a significant impact on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.

Some examples of companies that have developed breakthrough technologies related to low-carbon energy include:

- First Solar: First Solar is a leading manufacturer of thin-film solar PV panels. The company's technology has enabled it to become the world's largest solar PV panel producer, with a market share of around 15%. First Solar's panels have been used in a number of large-scale solar PV projects, including the Desert Sunlight Solar Farm in California, which is the largest solar PV project in the world.

- SunPower: SunPower is another leading manufacturer of thin-film solar PV panels. The company's technology is based on a unique design that enables its panels to capture more sunlight than traditional silicon-based solar PV panels. This makes SunPower's panels more efficient, and they are able to generate more electricity per square meter than any other type of solar PV panel.

- Vestas: Vestas is the world's largest wind turbine manufacturer. The company has installed more than 60,000 wind turbines in over 70 countries, and its turbines have a combined capacity of over 100 GW. Vestas' turbines are some of the most efficient in the world, and the company has been a leader in the development of new wind turbine technologies, such as the use of larger blades and taller towers.

- GE: GE is a leading manufacturer of both wind turbines and nuclear reactors. The company has a number of large-scale wind farms in operation, including the Shepherds Flat Wind Farm in Oregon, which is the largest wind farm in the United States. GE also has a number of nuclear reactors in operation around the world, including the Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant in the UK, which is the largest nuclear power plant in Europe.

- Carbon Clean Solutions: Carbon Clean Solutions is a leading provider of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. The company's technology can be used to capture CO2 emissions from power plants and other industrial facilities and store them underground. Carbon Clean Solutions has a number of CCS projects in operation around the world, including the world's largest CCS project, the Petra Nova CCS project in Texas.
