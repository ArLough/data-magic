## Progress Made



Some examples of companies and organizations that have developed breakthrough technologies related to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions are:

1. Carbon Engineering: Carbon Engineering is a Canadian company that has developed a technology called Direct Air Capture (DAC). DAC captures carbon dioxide (CO2) directly from the atmosphere and converts it into a synthetic fuel that can be used in cars and trucks. The company claims that its technology can capture one ton of CO2 per day for about $94 USD.

2. Climeworks: Climeworks is a Swiss company that has developed a technology called Direct Air Capture (DAC). DAC captures carbon dioxide (CO2) directly from the atmosphere and converts it into a synthetic fuel that can be used in cars and trucks. The company claims that its technology can capture one ton of CO2 per day for about $600 USD.

3. Global Thermostat: Global Thermostat is an American company that has developed a technology called Air to Fuel (A2F). A2F captures CO2 from the atmosphere and converts it into a synthetic fuel that can be used in cars and trucks. The company claims that its technology can capture one ton of CO2 per day for about $50 USD.
