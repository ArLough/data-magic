# Utility-Scale Energy Storage

## Progress Made



Some examples of companies and organizations that have developed breakthrough technologies related to greenhouse gas emissions reduction are Carbon Engineering, ExxonMobil, and Toyota. Carbon Engineering has developed a technology that captures carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and converts it into a product that can be used to make fuel. ExxonMobil has developed a process to convert natural gas into gasoline, which reduces emissions from transportation. Toyota has developed a fuel cell vehicle, which emits no greenhouse gases.
