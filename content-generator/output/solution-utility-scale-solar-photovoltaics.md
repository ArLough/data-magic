# Utility-Scale Solar Photovoltaics

## Progress Made



In the last few years, there have been many breakthrough technologies related to greenhouse gas emissions. For example, there are now more efficient ways to produce energy, ways to capture and store carbon dioxide, and ways to create biofuels. These technologies have had a big impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

## Lessons Learned



## Challenges Ahead



## Best Path Forward



1. The technology must be developed to a point where it is able to be implemented on a large scale.
2. The technology must be rigorously tested to ensure that it is effective in mitigating the effects of climate change.
3. The technology must be adopted by countries and organizations that are able to implement it on a large scale.
