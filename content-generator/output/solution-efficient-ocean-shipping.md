## Progress Made



Some examples of companies and organizations that have developed breakthrough technologies related to climate change and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions include:

1. CarbonCure Technologies - CarbonCure is a Canadian company that has developed technology to capture and reuse carbon dioxide emissions from concrete manufacturing. The company's technology injects carbon dioxide into wet concrete, where it reacts with calcium to form a mineral that strengthens the concrete. This process reduces the carbon footprint of concrete manufacturing by up to 30%.

2. Tesla Motors - Tesla Motors is an American company that manufactures electric vehicles. Tesla's vehicles emit zero emissions, and the company has plans to make its vehicles even more energy-efficient in the future.

3. International Renewable Energy Agency - The International Renewable Energy Agency is an intergovernmental organization that promotes the use of renewable energy around the world. The organization has developed a number of programs and initiatives to help countries transition to renewable energy, including training courses, policy recommendations, and financing mechanisms.

These are just a few examples of the progress that has been made in the area of climate change and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. There are many other companies and organizations working on similar technologies and solutions.
