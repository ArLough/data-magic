## Progress Made



Some examples of companies and organizations that have developed breakthrough technologies related to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions include Carbon Engineering, which has developed a process to capture carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere; and Climeworks, which has developed a process to capture carbon dioxide from ambient air and use it to enhance oil recovery. These technologies have the potential to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help mitigate climate change.

## Lessons Learned




The technology itself is not a panacea, but it can be used in concert with other measures to help reduce the effects of climate change. One of the main lessons learned is that public engagement and buy-in is essential for the successful adoption and use of the technology. In addition, it is important to consider the potential impacts of the technology on the environment and human health before deployment.

## Challenges Ahead



## Best Path Forward



1. The technology needs to be developed to a point where it is economically viable on a large scale.
2. The technology needs to be proven to be effective in mitigating the effects of climate change.
3. The technology needs to be adopted by a large number of people and organizations.
