## Progress Made



In the past decade, there have been many breakthrough technologies related to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. One example is carbon capture and storage (CCS), which is a process of capturing carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and industrial facilities and storing it underground. CCS has been developed and implemented by several companies and organizations, including the U.S. Department of Energy, the American Electric Power Company, and the SaskPower utility in Canada. CCS has been shown to be an effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from power plants and other industrial facilities, and it is expected to play a key role in meeting future emissions reduction targets.

## Challenges Ahead



## Best Path Forward



1. The technology needs to be developed to a point where it is cost-effective and can be easily implemented on a large scale.
2. There needs to be a concerted effort to educate the public on the benefits of the technology and how it can help mitigate the effects of climate change.
3. The technology needs to be adopted by governments and businesses as a way to help reduce their carbon footprints.
4. There needs to be continued research and development of the technology to ensure that it is constantly improving and becoming more effective.
