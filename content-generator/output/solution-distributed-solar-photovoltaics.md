## Progress Made

Progress has been made in developing distributed solar photovoltaics to reverse climate change. Breakthrough technologies that have been developed include solar photovoltaic cells, solar thermal collectors, and solar power towers. These technologies have contributed to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by providing renewable energy that does not emit greenhouse gases.

## Lessons Learned

Some key lessons that have been learned in the development and implementation of Distributed Solar Photovoltaics to mitigate the effects of climate change include:

1. The need for a comprehensive and coordinated effort from all stakeholders involved in the development and implementation of the technology.

2. The importance of setting realistic goals and timelines to ensure the success of the project.

3. The need for careful planning and execution to ensure the smooth functioning of the technology.

4. The importance of monitoring and evaluating the progress of the project to identify any potential problems and areas for improvement.

## Challenges Ahead

The challenge with solar photovoltaic (PV) technology is that it is still relatively expensive compared to other forms of energy generation. This means that there is still a relatively small market for solar PV, which in turn means that there is less investment in research and development, and less competition to drive down prices.

The other challenge is that solar PV is a diffuse source of energy, meaning that it is not possible to concentrated solar PV (CSP) technologies. This means that solar PV cannot be used to provide ' baseload ' power, which is the minimum level of power that a grid needs to meet demand. This means that solar PV needs to be supplemented with other forms of generation, such as wind or nuclear, which can provide baseload power.

Finally, solar PV is a intermittent source of energy, meaning that it only generates power when the sun is shining. This means that solar PV needs to be supplemented with storage, such as batteries, to provide power when the sun is not shining.

## Best Path Forward

The best path forward for the continued development and implementation of Distributed Solar Photovoltaics (DSPV) to effectively mitigate the effects of climate change is to continue to research and develop the technology so that it is more efficient and less expensive. Additionally, steps need to be taken to increase public awareness of DSPV and to encourage more people and businesses to adopt the technology.
