## Progress Made



Some examples of companies and organizations that have developed breakthrough technologies related to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions are:

1. Carbon Engineering
2. C-Capture
3. Climeworks
4. GreenPowerMonitor

These companies have all developed innovative technologies that capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and convert it into a usable product, such as fuel or building materials. This process of carbon capture and utilization (CCU) can help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by taking CO2 out of the atmosphere and using it to create products, instead of letting it escape into the atmosphere.

1. Carbon Engineering is a Canadian company that has developed a technology to capture carbon dioxide from the air and convert it into a fuel. The company’s Air to Fuels plant in Squamish, British Columbia, can capture up to one tonne of CO2 per day and turn it into about 200 liters of gasoline or diesel.

2. C-Capture is a UK-based company that has developed a technology to capture carbon dioxide from power plant exhaust gases. The company’s technology can capture up to 90% of the CO2 from a power plant’s exhaust gas, and it is currently being tested at a coal-fired power plant in the UK.

3. Climeworks is a Swiss company that has developed a technology to capture carbon dioxide from the air and use it to enhance greenhouse horticulture. The company’s CO2 capture plant in Hinwil, Switzerland, can capture up to 900 kilograms of CO2 per day. The CO2 is then used to enhance the growth of greenhouse plants.

4. GreenPowerMonitor is a Spanish company that has developed a technology to monitor and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. GreenPowerMonitor’s technology is used at over 1,000 power plants in more than 40 countries. The company’s software platform helps power plant operators to optimize their operations and reduce their emissions.
