## Progress Made



In the past decade, there has been significant progress made in developing breakthrough technologies related to greenhouse gas emissions reduction. Companies and organizations such as Tesla, Nissan, and Toyota have developed electric cars that are much more efficient than traditional gasoline cars. Electric cars emit far less greenhouse gases than gasoline cars, and their use is growing rapidly. In addition, solar and wind energy have become much more affordable and efficient, and are now providing a significant amount of electricity in many parts of the world. These renewable energy sources emit no greenhouse gases, and their use is also growing rapidly. As a result of these and other advances, greenhouse gas emissions have begun to decline in many parts of the world, and the trend is expected to continue.
