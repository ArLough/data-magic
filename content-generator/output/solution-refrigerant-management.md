## Best Path Forward



1. The technology should be developed and implemented in a way that is sensitive to the needs of those who are most vulnerable to climate change.

2. The technology should be affordable and accessible to as many people as possible.

3. The technology should be easy to use and should not require special training or skills to operate.

4. The technology should be continuously improved and updated to ensure that it is as effective as possible in mitigating the effects of climate change.
