## Progress Made



Some examples of companies and organizations that have developed breakthrough technologies related to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions are:

1. The Carbon Capture and Sequestration Technologies Program at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, which is developing new technologies to capture carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and other industrial sources, and store them underground.

2. The Global Thermostat, which is developing a technology to capture carbon dioxide emissions from the atmosphere and store them underground.

3. The Climate Group, which is an international organization that works with businesses and governments to transition to low-carbon economies.

4. The Renewable Energy and Efficiency Partnership, which is a public-private partnership between the United States Department of Energy and more than 30 companies and organizations, that is working to accelerate the development and deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies.

1. Education and awareness: It is important to educate and raise awareness about climate change and the potential mitigation strategies available. This can be done through public campaigns, school curricula, and media coverage.

2. Research and development: Continued research and development is necessary to improve and refine climate change mitigation strategies. This includes both technological development and policy research.

3. Implementation and monitoring: Once mitigation strategies have been developed and researched, they need to be implemented on a large scale. This requires coordination between governments, businesses, and individuals. Additionally, it is important to monitor the effects of climate change mitigation strategies to ensure that they are effective.
