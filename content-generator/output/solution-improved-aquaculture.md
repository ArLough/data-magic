## Progress Made

Aquaculture is the farming of fish, shellfish, and other aquatic animals and plants. It is a rapidly growing industry that provides a major source of food for people around the world. Aquaculture is also an important part of the global economy, generating billions of dollars in revenue each year.

The aquaculture industry has made significant progress in recent years in developing improved aquaculture practices that can help to reverse climate change. One major breakthrough has been the development of closed-loop aquaculture systems that recycle water and nutrients, greatly reducing the need for inputs from outside the system. These systems can be used to farm a variety of fish, shellfish, and other aquatic animals and plants, and have the potential to greatly reduce the environmental impact of aquaculture.

Other breakthrough technologies that have been developed include the use of alternative feeds that are based on plant proteins instead of fishmeal, and the use of innovative technologies to improve the efficiency of water use in aquaculture operations. These and other advances are helping to make aquaculture more sustainable and less damaging to the environment.

## Lessons Learned

Some of the key lessons that have been learned in the development and implementation of Improved Aquaculture to mitigate the effects of climate change include the importance of:

1. Selecting the right location: It is important to select a location for aquaculture that is not vulnerable to flooding or other extreme weather events.

2. Use of climate-resistant species: It is important to use species of fish that are resistant to the effects of climate change, such as warm water fish.

3. Proper management: It is important to properly manage aquaculture facilities, including maintaining water quality and ensuring that fish are healthy.

4. Use of technology: It is important to use technology to help mitigate the effects of climate change, such as using recirculating aquaculture systems.

5. Education and training: It is important to educate and train those involved in aquaculture on the importance of mitigating the effects of climate change.

## Challenges Ahead

The major challenges that remain in the development and implementation of Improved Aquaculture to reverse climate change are:

1. The need to develop more efficient and environmentally friendly methods of aquaculture production.

2. The need to find ways to reduce the environmental impacts of aquaculture.

3. The need to improve the management and regulation of aquaculture operations.

## Best Path Forward

The best path forward for the continued development and implementation of Improved Aquaculture to effectively mitigate the effects of climate change is to continue to research and develop the technology so that it can be adopted on a large scale. In order to ensure that this technology is adopted on a large scale and is effective, it is important to continue to educate the public on the benefits of this technology and to make it affordable for everyone.
