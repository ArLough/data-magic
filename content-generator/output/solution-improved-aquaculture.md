## Progress Made



Some examples of companies and organizations that have developed breakthrough technologies related to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions reductions are:

1. Carbon Engineering - Carbon Engineering is a Canadian company that has developed a technology called Direct Air Capture (DAC). DAC technology captures carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere, which can then be used to create fuel or other products. This technology can be used to offset industrial emissions, or to create "negative emissions" by removing more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than is released.

2. Global Thermostat - Global Thermostat is a US-based company that has developed a technology called Air-Capture. Air-Capture technology captures carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and sequesters it underground. This technology can be used to offset industrial emissions, or to create "negative emissions" by removing more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than is released.

3. Climeworks - Climeworks is a Swiss company that has developed a technology called Direct Air Capture. Direct Air Capture technology captures carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere, which can then be used to create fuel or other products. This technology can be used to offset industrial emissions, or to create "negative emissions" by removing more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than is released.

4. Blue Planet - Blue Planet is a Japanese company that has developed a technology called Ocean-Thermal Energy Conversion. Ocean-Thermal Energy Conversion technology uses the temperature difference between the surface and deep waters of the ocean to generate electricity. This technology has the potential to displace fossil fuel-based power generation, and help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

5. SDEnergy - SDEnergy is a Canadian company that has developed a technology called Solar Power Tower. Solar Power Tower technology uses mirrors to focus sunlight onto a central tower, where the heat is used to generate electricity. This technology has the potential to displace fossil fuel-based power generation, and help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
