## Progress Made



Some examples of companies and organizations that have developed breakthrough technologies related to reducing greenhouse gas emissions include:

1. Carbon Engineering: Carbon Engineering is a Canadian company that has developed a technology called Direct Air Capture (DAC). This technology captures carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere and converts it into a concentrated stream of CO2 that can be used for things like enhanced oil recovery or as feedstock for making synthetic fuels.

2. Climeworks: Climeworks is a Swiss company that has developed a technology called Direct Air Capture with Carbon dioxide Removal (DAC-R). This technology captures carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere and stores it deep underground.

3. Global Thermostat: Global Thermostat is an American company that has developed a technology called Air to Fuel (A2F). This technology captures carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere and converts it into a fuel that can be used in traditional combustion engines.

4. Carbon Clean Solutions: Carbon Clean Solutions is an Indian company that has developed a technology called Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). This technology captures carbon dioxide from industrial emitters like power plants and stores it deep underground.

5. Svante: Svante is a Canadian company that has developed a technology called Carbon Capture and Utilization (CCU). This technology captures carbon dioxide from industrial emitters and uses it to make products like concrete and plastics.

6. Blue Planet: Blue Planet is an American company that has developed a technology called Ocean Fertilization. This technology captures carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and uses it to fertilize the oceans, which helps to grow more phytoplankton. Phytoplankton are a key part of the marine food chain and they also help to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
