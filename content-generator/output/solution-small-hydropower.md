## Progress Made

There have been many advances in small hydropower technology in recent years. One major breakthrough has been the development of more efficient turbines. These turbines are able to extract more energy from the water flowing through them, resulting in more electricity being generated with less water. This means that less water is needed to generate the same amount of electricity, and therefore less greenhouse gas emissions are produced.

Another breakthrough has been the development of better methods for storing water in reservoirs. These methods allow for water to be stored for longer periods of time, which reduces the need to release it from the reservoirs during dry periods. This reduces the amount of water that is lost through evaporation, and therefore reduces the amount of greenhouse gas emissions that are produced.

Finally, advances in monitoring and control technology have also helped to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from small hydropower plants. These technologies allow operators to more accurately monitor and control the flow of water through the turbines, ensuring that the turbines are operating at their most efficient levels. This reduces the amount of energy that is wasted, and therefore reduces the amount of greenhouse gas emissions that are produced.

## Lessons Learned

Some of the key lessons that have been learned in the development and implementation of Small Hydropower to mitigate the effects of climate change include the importance of:

1. Identifying and assessing potential sites for hydropower development

2. Ensuring that hydropower development does not adversely impact local ecosystems

3. Engaging local communities in the planning and implementation of hydropower projects

4. Managing water resources efficiently to minimize the environmental impact of hydropower development

5. Monitoring and assessing the environmental impact of hydropower development over time

Despite these lessons, there have been a number of failures associated with the development and implementation of Small Hydropower. These failures include:

1. The over-development of hydropower resources leading to negative environmental impacts

2. The failure to adequately engage local communities in the planning and implementation of hydropower projects

3. The inadequate management of water resources leading to water shortages and environmental degradation

4. The inadequate monitoring and assessment of the environmental impact of hydropower development leading to negative surprises

5. The lack of an effective policy and regulatory framework to guide and oversee the development and implementation of hydropower projects

## Challenges Ahead

The major challenges that remain in the development and implementation of Small Hydropower to reverse climate change are:

1) The need for more efficient and reliable technology
2) The need for more effective and affordable financing
3) The need for more efficient and coordinated planning and regulation

## Best Path Forward

The best path forward for the continued development and implementation of small hydropower to effectively mitigate the effects of climate change is to continue to research and develop the technology and to incentivize its adoption. Steps that need to be taken to ensure that small hydropower is adopted on a large scale include:

1. Increasing public awareness of the technology and its benefits
2. Providing financial incentives for adopting small hydropower
3. Working with governments and utility companies to promote the technology
4. Supporting research and development to improve the technology
