# Small Hydropower

## Progress Made



Some examples of companies and organizations that have developed breakthrough technologies related to reducing greenhouse gas emissions are:

1. Carbon Engineering: Carbon Engineering is a Canadian clean energy company that has developed a technology called Direct Air Capture (DAC). DAC involves capturing carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere and then storing it underground. This technology can be used to reduce atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, and thus mitigate climate change.

2. Climeworks: Climeworks is a Swiss company that has developed a technology called Direct Air Capture with Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). This technology captures carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and stores it underground. CCS can be used to reduce atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, and thus mitigate climate change.

3. Global Thermostat: Global Thermostat is an American clean energy company that has developed a technology called Air to Fuels (A2F). A2F involves capturing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and converting it into fuels such as methane and methanol. This technology can be used to reduce atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, and thus mitigate climate change.
