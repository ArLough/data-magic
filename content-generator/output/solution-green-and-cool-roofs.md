## Progress Made

One of the most promising and effective ways to reverse climate change is to develop and implement green and cool roofs. Green roofs are vegetated roofs that help to insulate buildings and reduce the Urban Heat Island Effect. Cool roofs are reflective roofs that reflect sunlight and heat away from buildings. Both of these types of roofs can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions from buildings.

There have been many breakthrough technologies that have been developed in recent years to make green and cool roofs more effective. For example, new materials and coatings have been developed that allow cool roofs to reflect even more sunlight and heat away from buildings. Green roofs have also been made more effective through the use of new soil mixes and planting techniques that help to improve the growth and health of vegetation.

These breakthrough technologies have helped to make green and cool roofs more effective at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, they have also made these types of roofs more affordable and easier to install. As a result, more and more building owners and developers are beginning to adopt green and cool roofs as a way to reduce their carbon footprint.

## Lessons Learned

Green roofs can be an effective way to mitigate the effects of climate change by providing a number of benefits, including reducing the amount of heat that is absorbed by the building, reducing stormwater runoff, and improving air quality. However, green roofs can also be expensive to install and maintain, and they may not be suitable for all types of buildings.

## Challenges Ahead

There are a few major challenges that remain in the development and implementation of Green and Cool Roofs to reverse climate change. One obstacle is the high initial cost of installation, which deters many building owners from adopting the technology. Additionally, green and cool roofs require more maintenance than traditional roofs, and there is a lack of trained professionals to properly care for them. Additionally, the benefits of green and cool roofs are not always well understood, which makes it difficult to justify the investment to many building owners.

## Best Path Forward

The best path forward for the continued development and implementation of Green and Cool Roofs to effectively mitigate the effects of climate change is to continue to invest in research and development to improve the technology and to make it more affordable. In addition, it is important to raise awareness of the benefits of green and cool roofs and to encourage more building owners and developers to adopt them.
