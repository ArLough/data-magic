## Progress Made



Some examples of companies and organizations that have developed breakthrough technologies related to climate change and the environment are:

1. Carbon Engineering - Carbon Engineering is a Canadian company that has developed a technology called Direct Air Capture (DAC), which captures carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere and converts it into a fuel.

2. Climeworks - Climeworks is a Swiss company that has developed a technology called Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), which captures CO2 from the atmosphere and stores it in the ground.

3. Global Thermostat - Global Thermostat is an American company that has developed a technology called Air to Fuel (A2F), which converts CO2 into a fuel.

4. GreenPower - GreenPower is an Australian company that has developed a technology called Waste to Energy (WtE), which converts waste into energy.

5. Renewable Energy Systems (RES) - Renewable Energy Systems is a British company that has developed a technology called Anaerobic Digestion (AD), which converts organic waste into energy.

The impact of these technologies on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions has been significant. For example, Carbon Engineering's DAC technology has the potential to capture and store up to 1 billion tons of CO2 per year, while Climeworks' CCS technology can capture and store up to 3.2 billion tons of CO2 per year.
