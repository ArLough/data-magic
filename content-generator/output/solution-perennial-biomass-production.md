## Progress Made

In the last few years, there has been significant progress in developing perennial staple crops that can reverse climate change. One of the most important breakthrough technologies has been the development of new varieties of wheat that can be grown in a wide variety of climates. These new wheat varieties have been bred to be more tolerant of drought and heat, and they require less water and fertilizer than traditional varieties. This has led to a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture. Other breakthrough technologies that have contributed to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions include the development of new varieties of rice that require less water and the development of new methods of growing crops that reduce soil erosion.

## Lessons Learned

Some of the key lessons that have been learned in the development and implementation of Perennial Staple Crops to mitigate the effects of climate change include the importance of choosing the right site, preparing the site properly, and using the right mix of species. It is also important to monitor the progress of the crop and make adjustments as needed. Additionally, it is important to have a plan for what to do if the crop fails.

## Challenges Ahead

The challenges that remain in the development and implementation of Perennial Staple Crops to reverse climate change are:
* The lack of genetic diversity in perennial staple crops. This limits the ability of farmers to adapt to climate change and increases the risk of crop failure.
* The lack of knowledge and awareness about the benefits of perennial staple crops. This limits the adoption of this technology by farmers.
* The lack of infrastructure to support the cultivation of perennial staple crops. This limits the ability of farmers to scale up production.

## Best Path Forward

There is no single best path forward for the continued development and implementation of Perennial Staple Crops to effectively mitigate the effects of climate change. A variety of approaches may be needed to ensure that this technology is adopted on a large scale and is effective. Some possible steps that could be taken to promote the adoption of perennial staple crops include:

1. Providing financial incentives for farmers to switch to growing perennial staple crops.

2. Educating farmers about the benefits of growing perennial staple crops.

3. Demonstrating the feasibility of growing perennial staple crops on a large scale.

4. Working with seed companies to develop new varieties of perennial staple crops that are well-suited to local conditions.

5. Establishing long-term research programs to continue to improve the efficiency and productivity of perennial staple crops.
