## Progress Made



Some examples of companies that have developed breakthrough technologies related to climate change are Tesla, SunPower, and First Solar. These companies have developed solar panels that are significantly more efficient than traditional panels, making it more feasible for homeowners and businesses to switch to renewable energy sources. In addition, these companies have also developed storage technologies that allow solar energy to be stored and used even when the sun is not shining. This is a major breakthrough, as it means that solar energy can now be used as a reliable and consistent source of power, even in places where the sun does not always shine.
