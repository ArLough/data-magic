## Progress Made



Some examples of companies and organizations that have developed breakthrough technologies related to reducing greenhouse gas emissions are:

1. Carbon Engineering: Carbon Engineering is a Canadian company that has developed a technology called Direct Air Capture (DAC). DAC involves capturing carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere and then storing it underground. This technology can be used to remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere and help mitigate climate change.

2. Climeworks: Climeworks is a Swiss company that has developed a technology called Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). CCS involves capturing carbon dioxide from power plants and other industrial facilities, and then storing it underground. This technology can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions from these facilities, and help mitigate climate change.

3. GreenPower: GreenPower is an Australian company that has developed a technology called Renewable Energy (RE). RE involves generating electricity from renewable sources such as solar, wind, and hydro. This technology can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, and help mitigate climate change.
