## Progress Made



Some examples of companies and organizations that have developed breakthrough technologies related to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions are:

1. Carbon Engineering: Carbon Engineering is a Canadian company that has developed a technology called Direct Air Capture (DAC), which can remove carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere. The company is currently piloting a DAC plant in Squamish, British Columbia, and plans to use the technology to create a negative emissions power plant.

2. CarbonCure Technologies: CarbonCure is a Canadian company that has developed a technology that can capture and store carbon dioxide in concrete. The company’s technology is being used by concrete producers in North America and Europe, and has resulted in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by up to 30%.

3. Svante Inc.: Svante is a Canadian company that has developed a technology called the Svante Array, which can capture and store carbon dioxide from power plants. The Svante Array is currently being piloted at a power plant in Canada, and the company plans to use the technology to create a negative emissions power plant.

4. Global Thermostat: Global Thermostat is an American company that has developed a technology that can capture and store carbon dioxide from power plants and industrial facilities. The company’s technology is currently being piloted at a power plant in the United States, and the company plans to use the technology to create a negative emissions power plant.

5. Climeworks: Climeworks is a Swiss company that has developed a technology called the Climeworks Carbon Capture Machine, which can capture and store carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The company plans to use the technology to create a negative emissions power plant, and is currently piloting the technology at a power plant in Iceland.
