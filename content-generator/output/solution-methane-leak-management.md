## Progress Made



Some examples of companies and organizations that have developed breakthrough technologies related to reducing greenhouse gas emissions include:

1. Carbon Engineering: Carbon Engineering is a Canadian company that has developed a technology that can capture carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere. The company plans to use the captured carbon dioxide to make fuel for cars and trucks.

2. Clean Air Task Force: The Clean Air Task Force is an organization that works to develop and promote technologies that reduce air pollution. One of the technologies the organization has worked on is a system that captures carbon dioxide from power plant emissions and stores it underground.

3. GE: GE is a multinational corporation that makes a variety of products, including power plant equipment. The company has developed a technology called "carbon capture and sequestration" which captures carbon dioxide from power plant emissions and stores it underground.

4. Tesla: Tesla is a company that specializes in electric vehicles. The company has developed a technology called "vehicle-to-grid" which allows electric vehicles to sell electricity back to the grid when demand is high.

5. These are just a few examples of the many companies and organizations that are working on developing technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The impact of these technologies is already being felt, and as they continue to be developed and adopted, the impact will only grow.
