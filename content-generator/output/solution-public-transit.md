## Progress Made



In the past decade, there have been many breakthroughs in the area of renewable energy technology. One example is the development of more efficient solar panels. Solar panels are now able to convert more of the sun's energy into electricity, which can be used to power homes and businesses. This technology has had a major impact on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, as it provides a clean and renewable source of energy. Other examples of companies and organizations that have developed breakthrough technologies related to renewable energy include Tesla, which has developed batteries that can store large amounts of energy, and Google, which has developed a way to use artificial intelligence to improve the efficiency of solar panels.
