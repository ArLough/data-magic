## Progress Made

There has been significant progress in developing recycled metals to reverse climate change. One example of a breakthrough technology that has been developed is the process of smelting metal ores using recycled metals. This process requires less energy and produces less greenhouse gas emissions than traditional smelting methods. Additionally, new technologies have been developed that allow for the recycling of metals from electronic waste. These technologies have contributed to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by allowing for the reuse of metals that would otherwise be discarded.

## Lessons Learned

Some key lessons that have been learned in the development and implementation of Recycled Metals to mitigate the effects of climate change include:

1. The need for a long-term perspective: Recycled metals can provide significant environmental benefits, but these benefits can take years or even decades to materialize. For example, the energy savings from recycling aluminum cans only occurs when the recycled cans are used to make new cans.

2. The need for consistent policies and regulations: Inconsistent policies and regulations can hamper the effectiveness of recycled metals programs. For example, if recycling programs pay out different prices for different metals, this can create an incentive for unscrupulous operators to mix metals together, making it more difficult to recycle them effectively.

3. The need for public education and outreach: Public education and outreach are essential to the success of recycled metals programs. The public needs to be aware of the benefits of recycling and how to properly recycle metals.

4. The need for infrastructure: Recycled metals programs require a well-developed infrastructure in order to be successful. This infrastructure includes collection facilities, processing facilities, and end-markets for the recycled metals.

5. The need for financial incentives: Financial incentives can be an important part of recycled metals programs. These incentives can include subsidies, tax breaks, or other forms of financial assistance.

## Challenges Ahead

There are a few major challenges that remain in the development and implementation of recycled metals to reverse climate change. One is the need to develop a reliable and consistent supply of high-quality recycled metals. This can be a challenge because metals recycling is often done on a small scale and there can be a lot of variation in the quality of the materials. Another challenge is to find ways to use recycled metals in a way that is economically viable. This may require developing new technologies or processes, or finding ways to use recycled metals in applications where they can replace more expensive materials. Finally, it is important to ensure that the recycling of metals does not create other environmental problems, such as emissions of greenhouse gases or pollutants.

## Best Path Forward

The best path forward for the continued development and implementation of recycled metals to effectively mitigate the effects of climate change is to continue to research and develop the technology so that it can be adopted on a large scale. Steps that need to be taken to ensure that this technology is effective include:

1. Increasing public awareness of the benefits of recycling metals.

2. Making recycling metals more convenient and accessible.

3. Developing infrastructure to support large-scale recycling of metals.

4. Creating incentives for businesses to recycle metals.

5. Establishing regulations to require recycling of metals.
