## Progress Made



Some examples of companies and organizations that have developed breakthrough technologies related to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions are:

1. Carbon Engineering: Carbon Engineering is a Canadian company that has developed a technology called Direct Air Capture (DAC). DAC involves capturing carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere and storing it underground. This technology has the potential to reduce atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide by up to 1 billion tonnes per year.

2. Climeworks: Climeworks is a Swiss company that has developed a technology called Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR). CDR involves capturing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it in underground reservoirs. This technology has the potential to reduce atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide by up to 5 billion tonnes per year.

3. Global Thermostat: Global Thermostat is an American company that has developed a technology called Air Capture. Air Capture involves capturing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it in underground reservoirs. This technology has the potential to reduce atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide by up to 10 billion tonnes per year.
