## Progress Made



Some examples of companies and organizations that have developed breakthrough technologies related to greenhouse gas emissions reduction are:

1) The Carbon Capture and Storage Association (CCSA) is an industry-led organization that is working to promote the development and deployment of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies. CCS involves capturing carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and other industrial facilities, transporting the CO2 to a storage site, and then injecting it deep underground where it will be permanently stored.

2) The Global CCS Institute is an international non-profit organization that is working to accelerate the development and deployment of CCS technologies around the world. The Institute provides information and resources on CCS, and works with governments, businesses, and other stakeholders to promote CCS projects.

3) The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) is an intergovernmental organization that promotes the use of renewable energy technologies. IRENA works with governments, businesses, and other stakeholders to support the development and deployment of renewable energy technologies.

4) The ClimateWorks Foundation is a philanthropic organization that supports the development and deployment of clean energy technologies. ClimateWorks provides funding for projects that promote the use of low-carbon technologies, such as renewable energy and energy efficiency.

## Challenges Ahead



## Best Path Forward



1. The technology needs to be developed to a point where it is commercially viable and can be adopted on a large scale.
2. Governments and businesses need to be convinced of its efficacy and potential in mitigating the effects of climate change.
3. An infrastructure needs to be created to support its large-scale implementation.
4. Education and awareness campaigns need to be launched to ensure that the general public is on board with the technology and its potential benefits.
