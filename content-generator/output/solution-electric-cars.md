## Progress Made



Some examples of companies and organizations that have developed breakthrough technologies related to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions are:

1. Carbon Engineering: Carbon Engineering is a Canadian company that has developed a technology called Direct Air Capture (DAC). DAC removes carbon dioxide directly from the air, which can then be used to create fuel or to be stored underground. This technology has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 10 gigatons per year.

2. Climeworks: Climeworks is a Swiss company that has developed a technology called Carbon Capture and Utilization (CCU). CCU captures carbon dioxide from the air and then uses it to create products such as building materials, fertilizers, and even carbon-neutral fuels. This technology has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 1 gigaton per year.

3. Global Thermostat: Global Thermostat is an American company that has developed a technology called Air to Fuel (A2F). A2F converts carbon dioxide into a variety of fuels, including hydrogen and methanol. This technology has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 10 gigatons per year.

4. Svante: Svante is a Canadian company that has developed a technology called Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). CCS captures carbon dioxide from the air and then stores it underground. This technology has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 1 gigaton per year.
