## Progress Made

Sustainable intensification for smallholders is an approach to agriculture that seeks to improve yields while reducing environmental impacts. This can be accomplished through a variety of means, including the use of more efficient irrigation systems, the adoption of no-till or low-till farming practices, and the use of cover crops.

One example of a breakthrough technology that has contributed to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is the use of more efficient irrigation systems. These systems can help farmers to reduce the amount of water that is lost to evaporation, and they can also help to reduce the amount of energy that is required to pump water.

Another example of a technology that has contributed to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is the use of cover crops. Cover crops can help to reduce soil erosion, and they can also help to sequester carbon in the soil.

The adoption of sustainable intensification practices by smallholders can help to reduce the amount of greenhouse gas emissions that are released into the atmosphere, and can also help to improve the productivity of agricultural land.

## Lessons Learned

Some of the key lessons that have been learned in the development and implementation of Sustainable Intensification for Smallholders to mitigate the effects of climate change include the following:

1. It is important to involve smallholders in the planning and design process of Sustainable Intensification for Smallholders to ensure that the technology meets their needs and is appropriate for their farming system.

2. Sustainable Intensification for Smallholders technology needs to be affordable and accessible to smallholders.

3. The technology needs to be easy to use and maintain.

4. Sustainable Intensification for Smallholders technology needs to be resilient to climate change.

5. It is important to monitor and evaluate the impact of the technology on smallholders' livelihoods.

## Challenges Ahead

The major challenges that remain in the development and implementation of Sustainable Intensification for Smallholders to reverse climate change include:

1. The lack of awareness and understanding of the concept among smallholders.

2. The lack of technical and financial support for smallholders to implement sustainable intensification practices.

3. The lack of policy and institutional support for sustainable intensification.

4. The lack of market demand for products from sustainably intensified smallholder farms.

## Best Path Forward

The best path forward for the continued development and implementation of Sustainable Intensification for Smallholders to effectively mitigate the effects of climate change is to continue to research and develop new and improved methods of sustainable intensification and to promote and incentivize the adoption of these methods on a large scale. To ensure that this technology is adopted on a large scale and is effective, it is important to educate smallholders about the benefits of sustainable intensification and provide them with the resources and support they need to implement these practices on their farms.
