# Sustainable Intensification for Smallholders

## Progress Made



Some examples of companies and organizations that have developed breakthrough technologies related to climate change and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions include:

1. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology: CCS technology captures carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and other industrial facilities and stores them deep underground, preventing them from entering the atmosphere. This technology is being developed and deployed by a number of companies and organizations, including the Global CCS Institute, Carbon Engineering, and Climeworks.

2. Renewable energy: Renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydro power do not emit greenhouse gases when generating electricity. A number of companies and organizations are working on developing and deploying renewable energy technologies, including SunPower, First Solar, and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).

3. Electric vehicles: Electric vehicles are powered by electricity instead of fossil fuels, and produce zero emissions. A number of companies are working on developing and deploying electric vehicles, including Tesla, BMW, and Nissan.

4. Energy efficiency: Improving energy efficiency in buildings, appliances, and other areas can reduce the overall demand for energy, and therefore also reduce emissions. A number of companies and organizations are working on developing and deploying energy efficiency technologies, including the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the Alliance to Save Energy.
