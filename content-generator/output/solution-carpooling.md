## Progress Made

Carpooling has been shown to be an effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In one study, it was found that carpooling can reduce emissions by up to 30%.1 There are a number of reasons why carpooling is effective at reducing emissions. First, carpooling reduces the number of vehicles on the road, which reduces traffic congestion and saves fuel. Second, carpooling reduces the amount of time each vehicle is on the road, which reduces wear and tear on the vehicle and saves fuel. Third, carpooling allows people to share the cost of gas, which reduces the amount of money spent on gas.

There have been a number of breakthrough technologies that have been developed to make carpooling more effective. One example is the development of smart phone apps that allow people to find and connect with others who are looking to carpool. Another example is the development of carpool lanes, which are dedicated lanes on highways that are only for carpooling vehicles. These lanes help to reduce traffic congestion and save time.

## Lessons Learned

Some key lessons that have been learned in the development and implementation of Carpooling to mitigate the effects of climate change include the following:

1. It is important to have a clear and concise goal when implementing Carpooling. For example, a goal could be to reduce the number of vehicles on the road during peak hours by 10%.

2. It is important to engage all stakeholders in the development and implementation of Carpooling. This includes government agencies, businesses, and the general public.

3. It is important to have a robust marketing and outreach campaign to promote Carpooling. This campaign should include traditional media outlets as well as social media.

4. It is important to have a system in place to track the progress of Carpooling. This system should include data on the number of vehicles on the road, the number of carpoolers, and the emissions reductions achieved.

5. It is important to continuously monitor and evaluate the Carpooling program to ensure its efficacy and to make necessary adjustments.

## Challenges Ahead

The major challenges that remain in the development and implementation of Carpooling to reverse climate change are:

1. Scaling up and widely adopting the technology: Carpooling needs to be adopted on a much wider scale in order to have a significant impact on reversing climate change. There are a number of obstacles that need to be overcome to achieve this, including changing people's perceptions and behaviours, and increasing the availability and convenience of carpooling options.

2. Addressing the 'last mile' problem: One of the challenges of carpooling is that it is often not feasible or convenient to share a ride all the way to someone's destination. This 'last mile' problem needs to be addressed in order to make carpooling a more viable option for more people.

3. Managing demand and supply: Another challenge of carpooling is managing the demand and supply of rides. This can be a particular challenge during peak times or in areas with a high concentration of carpoolers.

4. Ensuring safety and security: Safety and security are important considerations when it comes to carpooling. It is important to ensure that carpooling is safe and secure for both drivers and passengers.

5. Managing costs: Carpooling can be a more cost-effective way to travel, but there are still costs associated with it. These need to be managed in order to make carpooling a more viable option for more people.

## Best Path Forward

The best path forward for the continued development and implementation of Carpooling to effectively mitigate the effects of climate change is to continue to develop the technology and make it more accessible to people. Additionally, awareness campaigns should be launched to encourage people to use Carpooling to reduce their emissions.
