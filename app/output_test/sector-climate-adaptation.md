## Overview

The Climate Adaptation sector is responsible for reversing the negative impacts of climate change. Climate Adaptation includes a wide range of technologies and practices that help us adapt to the changing climate. Climate Adaptation is so important because it helps us to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, and it also helps us to manage the impacts that we cannot avoid.

Climate Adaptation is one of the most important sectors for meeting the goals of the Paris Accords. The Paris Accords are a global agreement to limit the increase in global temperature to below 2Â°C. Climate Adaptation is essential for achieving this goal because it helps us to reduce the impacts of climate change, and it also helps us to cope with the impacts that we cannot avoid.
