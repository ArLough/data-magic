title: Coastal and Ocean Sinks
---

## Overview

As the world’s population continues to grow and put greater strain on the planet’s resources, it is becoming increasingly important to find ways to combat the negative effects of climate change. Coastal and ocean sinks play a crucial role in reversing the damage that has been done by humans to the environment.

 Coastal and ocean sinks are areas where carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are absorbed from the atmosphere and stored in the ocean. This process helps to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and slows the rate of climate change.

Project Drawdown estimates that if we implement coastal and ocean sinks on a large scale, we could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 10 gigatons by the year 2030. This would be a significant step towards meeting the goals of the Paris Accords and slowing the effects of climate change.
