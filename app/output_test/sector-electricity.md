## Overview

Electricity is the technology sector with the greatest potential to mitigate climate change. It is also the technology with the most potential to help meet the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement. In order to meet the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement, we must reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80% before 2030. Electricity is a key technology in achieving this reduction, as it can be used to displace fossil fuels in a number of sectors. For example, electric vehicles are much more efficient than gasoline vehicles, and electric heating is much more efficient than natural gas heating. In addition, a large share of global greenhouse gas emissions come from the electricity sector itself. Therefore, shifting to renewable electricity sources such as wind and solar can have a large impact on reducing emissions.
