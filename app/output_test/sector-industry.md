## Overview

The industrial sector is responsible for a large share of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, industry is the second largest emitting sector, accounting for approximately 24 percent of global emissions. The industrial sector includes a wide range of activities, from manufacturing to construction, and emits a variety of pollutants, including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), and perfluorocarbons (PFCs).

Reversing the negative impacts of climate change will require a significant reduction in emissions from the industrial sector. Project Drawdown’s analysis shows that there are a number of ways to achieve this reduction, including improving energy efficiency, switching to renewable energy, and using carbon capture and storage technologies.

Improving energy efficiency is the most important thing we can do to reduce emissions from the industrial sector. If we can improve the energy efficiency of the industrial sector by just 1 percent annually, it would be equivalent to eliminating all emissions from the transportation sector.

Switching to renewable energy is also a critical part of reducing emissions from the industrial sector. Renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, emit far less pollution than fossil fuels. If the industrial sector switched to renewable energy, it would reduce emissions by nearly 10 percent.

Finally, using carbon capture and storage technologies can also help reduce emissions from the industrial sector. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) involves capturing carbon dioxide emissions and storing them underground, where they cannot enter the atmosphere. If the industrial sector were to adopt CCS, it could reduce emissions by up to 15 percent.
