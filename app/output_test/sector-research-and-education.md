## Overview

Transportation is responsible for a large percentage of greenhouse gas emissions, and thus, is a critical sector for climate change mitigation. Project Drawdown's analysis shows that electric vehicles, public transport, and non-motorized transport are key solutions for reducing transportation emissions. These solutions are particularly important in the next decade, as we need to rapidly reduce emissions to meet the goals of the Paris Accords.
