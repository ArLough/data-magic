## Overview

Buildings are the places where we live, work, and play, and they are responsible for a huge amount of energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. But buildings can also be part of the solution to climate change. By using energy-efficient design and construction, and by using renewable energy for heating, cooling, and lighting, buildings can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and save money on energy bills.
