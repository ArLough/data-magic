title: Food Agriculture and Land Use

## Overview

The climate tech sector called Food Agriculture and Land Use is one of the most important sectors for reversing the negative impacts of climate change. Agriculture is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for about 10 percent of global emissions. However, agriculture also has the potential to be a major sink for carbon, through practices such as agroforestry, cover crops, and no-till farming. According to Project Drawdown, if these practices are adopted on a global scale, they have the potential to sequester enough carbon to cancel out the emissions from the entire agricultural sector. In addition, food waste is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, and reducing food waste can have a significant impact on mitigating climate change.
