title: Land Sinks
---

## Overview

Land sinks are a type of carbon sequestration that refers to the capture and storage of carbon dioxide in the soil. This can be done through a variety of means, such as planting trees, no-till agriculture, and restored wetlands. Land sinks are important because they provide a way to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which can help to reverse the effects of climate change. In addition, land sinks can help to improve soil health and water quality, and provide habitat for wildlife.
