title: Engineered Sinks

## Overview

Engineered Sinks are a type of carbon capture and storage technology that specifically captures carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and stores it in a variety of ways. This can be done through direct air capture, which captures carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and stores it in tanks or underground, or through bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, which captures carbon dioxide from power plants and stores it in the ground.

Engineered Sinks are important for reversing the negative impacts of climate change because they provide a way to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, which are the main driver of climate change. By 2030, it is estimated that Engineered Sinks could reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide levels by up to 1.5 gigatons, which is equivalent to the annual emissions of Russia. This would be a significant step in meeting the goals of the Paris Accords, which aim to keep global temperature rise below 2Â°C.
