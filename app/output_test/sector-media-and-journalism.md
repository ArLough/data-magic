## Overview

Climate change is the most pressing issue of our time, and media and journalism play a crucial role in reversing its negative impacts. According to Project Drawdown, media and journalism are responsible for communicating the urgency of the climate crisis and rallying public support for climate solutions. They also play a key role in holding corporations and governments accountable for their actions. In the next decade, media and journalism will be crucial for the success of the Paris Accords, which set a goal of limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius. To meet this goal, media and journalism must continue to raise awareness of the climate crisis and build public support for climate solutions.
