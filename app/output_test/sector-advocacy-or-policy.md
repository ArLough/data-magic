## Overview

Advocacy or Policy is critical for reversing the negative impacts of climate change. Project Drawdown estimates that if we implement all of the solutions in their report, we could reverse the warming trend by 2030. This means that Advocacy or Policy is one of the most important sectors for the challenges we face before 2030.
