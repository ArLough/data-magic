## Overview

Building Automation Systems (BAS) play a critical role in climate tech by providing automated control of a building's heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. By automatically regulating a building's temperature and humidity, BAS can significantly reduce a building's energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, BAS can also monitor and control a building's lighting and security systems, further reducing energy consumption and environmental impact.

## Progress Made

There has been significant progress in developing Building Automation Systems (BAS) to reverse climate change. One example of a breakthrough technology that has been developed is the use of Building Energy Management Systems (BEMS). BEMS are used to monitor and control the energy use of a building. They can be used to reduce the amount of energy used by a building, and to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases. Other examples of breakthrough technologies that have been developed include the use of solar panels and wind turbines. These technologies have contributed to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by providing a renewable source of energy.

## Lessons Learned

Some of the key lessons that have been learned in the development and implementation of Building Automation Systems to mitigate the effects of climate change include the importance of properly sizing and locating cooling and heating equipment, using high-efficiency equipment, and sealing and insulating buildings to minimize energy use. Additionally, it is important to have a comprehensive understanding of the building envelope and the HVAC system in order to properly control the indoor environment and minimize the need for energy-intensive mechanical systems. Additionally, building automation systems can be used to monitor and optimize energy use in real-time, which can help to reduce overall energy consumption.

## Challenges Ahead

The major challenges that remain in the development and implementation of Building Automation Systems to reverse climate change include:

1. Ensuring that the systems are able to accurately track and control energy use in buildings

2. Ensuring that the systems are able to seamlessly integrate with existing building management systems

3. Overcoming the initial cost investment required to implement the systems

4. Ensuring that the systems are able to withstand extreme weather conditions

5. Addressing potential security and privacy concerns associated with the use of building automation systems

## Best Path Forward

The best path forward for the continued development and implementation of Building Automation Systems to effectively mitigate the effects of climate change is to continue to develop and refine the technology so that it is more effective and efficient, and to promote its adoption on a large scale. To ensure that this technology is adopted on a large scale and is effective, it is important to educate building owners and operators about the benefits of these systems and how they can be used to improve energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, it is important to provide financial incentives for the adoption of these systems, such as tax breaks or subsidies.
