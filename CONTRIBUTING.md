## Contribution Guidelines

### Getting Started

1. Familiarize yourself with the Climate Tech Handbook project, its goals, and its codebase.
2. Set up the development environment by following the installation instructions in the README.
3. Identify an issue or feature you would like to work on. Check the Issues tab for existing issues, or propose a new one.

### Coding Standards

When working on the Climate Tech Handbook project, follow these coding standards:

- Write clean, maintainable, and efficient code.
- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), the official Python style guide.
- Use meaningful variable and function names that accurately describe their purpose.
- Break down complex logic into smaller functions or methods.
- Keep functions and methods short and focused on a single responsibility.

### Documentation

Ensure that your code is well-documented, following these guidelines:

- Include docstrings for all functions, classes, and methods, following the [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#383-functions-and-methods).
- Provide clear and concise comments to explain any complex logic or calculations.
- Update the project's README file to include any new features or changes in functionality.

### Testing

Before submitting your contribution, make sure that your changes are well-tested. At this early stage in development, writing unit tests is highly encouraged, but not required. However, manual testing and documentation are mandatory. This includes:

- (Optional) Writing unit tests for any new functions or methods.
- Ensuring that existing tests still pass after making changes, if applicable.
- Manually testing the application to ensure that your changes work as expected and do not introduce new bugs.
- Providing thorough documentation to accompany your changes.

### Submitting a Pull Request

When you're ready to contribute your changes, follow these steps:

1. Fork the Climate Tech Handbook repository.
2. Create a new branch for your changes. Use a descriptive name that reflects the purpose of your changes (e.g., `feature-add-new-section` or `fix-broken-link`).
3. Commit your changes to the new branch, ensuring that your commit messages are descriptive and follow [best practices](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).
4. Push your changes to your forked repository.
5. Create a new pull request, providing a clear and concise description of your changes and the motivation behind them. Include any relevant issue numbers.
6. Request a review from one or more project maintainers.

### Review Process

Once your pull request is submitted, a project maintainer will review your changes. They may provide feedback or request additional changes. Be prepared to engage in a constructive dialogue and be open to making revisions as needed.

After your changes have been reviewed and approved, a project maintainer will merge your pull request into the main branch.

### Recognition

We value your contributions to the Climate Tech Handbook, and we want to make sure you get the recognition you deserve. Your name will be added to the list of contributors in the project's README file and any other relevant documentation.

### Community

We believe that a strong and inclusive community is essential to the success of the Climate Tech Handbook. We encourage you to join our community, participate in discussions, and help others whenever possible. By working together, we can make the Climate Tech Handbook an invaluable resource for everyone interested in climate technology.
